## Live Data Analytics Engine: A Comprehensive Overview

**Live Data Analytics Engine** is a lightweight, modular C++ project designed for real-time data simulation, collection, and analysis. Its primary goal is to provide a robust and efficient framework for understanding and processing continuous data streams, making it ideal for applications in IoT, financial analytics, sensor data processing, and more. The modular architecture ensures easy maintainability, extensibility, and integration with other systems.

### 🧩 Core Components

The project is structured around three main components, each with a distinct role in the data pipeline:

1.  **StreamSimulator**:
    *   **Function**: Responsible for generating synthetic data streams that mimic real-world data sources.
    *   **Details**: Produces continuous data points, typically including a `timestamp` and a numerical `value`. This allows for testing the data processing pipeline without needing a live external data source.

2.  **DataCollector**:
    *   **Function**: Manages the ingestion and storage of data generated by the `StreamSimulator`.
    *   **Details**: Can store data temporarily in memory (RAM) for rapid access or persistently in files for longer-term retention and analysis. Ensures data integrity and prevents loss during transit.

3.  **AnalyticsCore**:
    *   **Function**: Performs preliminary and statistical analysis on the collected data.
    *   **Details**: Capable of calculating basic statistical metrics such as mean, variance, and standard deviation. Designed to be extensible, allowing for the integration of more complex analytical models, including machine learning algorithms.

### 🚀 Build & Run

To compile and execute the project, follow these steps:

    📄 Example Output
Upon successful execution, the engine will produce a stream of processed data in a structured JSON format. An example of the console output is shown below:
    [
  {"timestamp": 1764065824, "value": 80.6},
  {"timestamp": 1764065825, "value": 55.9},
  {"timestamp": 1764065825, "value": 64.5}
]



Key Features
Modular Architecture: Designed for easy maintenance, understanding, and future expansion.
High Performance: Developed in C++17 to ensure speed and efficiency in data processing.
JSON Output: Generates human-readable and machine-parsable JSON output, facilitating integration with other systems (e.g., Python scripts, web dashboards).
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Utilizes CMake for a streamlined build process across Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Unit Testing: Includes comprehensive unit tests (powered by Catch2) to ensure code reliability and robustness.
Educational Value: Serves as an excellent example for learning about data stream processing concepts and modern C++ application architecture.
